> Every lab you turn in will have a README.md file. This file will contain a running work log of everything you did for this lab. I especially want to know where you got stuck along the way and what you did to get out of being stuck. One to two sentences isnâ€™t going to cut it here: this is the only opportunity you are going to get to document your own progression so take it seriously. At the end of the semester, I should be able to read through all the README.md files and have a good idea of your growth--as should you!

This lab was pretty confusing as I had no experience with using d3 prior to this and had to make 2 graphs with only the example code given to me. I also saw some examples of other graphs online when researching how to do this lab, but every one was different and it was very confusing. As a result, I wasn't able to get my graphs to be as polished as I would like, but it fufills the minimum requirements I guess. I really wanted to get tooltips to work but my inexperience with d3 and svgs made the whole process very convoluted and confusing for me so I eventually gave up.

I liked using mongo for this though, as I used my API for lab 5 that I created to get data from. I would like to connect this lab to the previous ones so I can get a constantly updated visualization, but right now I don't have time for that.

```js
app.get('/lab7/populate', (req, res) => {
    const token = req.query.token;
    console.log(token)
    let options = {
        url: "https://api.spotify.com/v1/me/top/artists?limit=400",
        headers: {
            'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + token
        },
        json: true
    };
    let data = [];
    request.get(options, function(error, response, body) {
        body['items'].forEach(el => {
            data.push({Artist: el['name'], Followers: el['followers']['total'], Popularity: el['popularity']});
        })
        // update specific thing
        const filter = {number: 1};
        const replace = {$set: {data: data}};
        const options = {upsert: false};
    
        collection.updateOne(filter, replace, options)
        .then(result => {
            // if (error) { return res.status(500).send(error); }
            console.log(result)
            if (result["modifiedCount"] == 0) {
            res.status(400).send(result);
            } else {
            res.status(200).send(result);
            }
        })
        
        fs.writeFileSync("test.json", JSON.stringify(data));
        // res.status(200).send(data)

    })


})
